Electron.js Project Setup Guide
This README.md provides a step-by-step guide on setting up an Electron.js project. Electron is a popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up your Electron.js project:

1. Create a New Directory
Start by creating a new directory for your project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
mkdir electron-project
Change into the project directory:
cd electron-project

2.Initialize a Node.js Project
Next, initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a package.json file that keeps track of your project's dependencies and settings. Run the following command and follow the prompts:

bash
npm init

3. Install Electron
Install Electron as a development dependency in your project by running:

bash
npm install electron --save-dev

4. Create the Main and Renderer Processes
In Electron, applications typically have two processes: the main process and the renderer process. The main process manages the application's lifecycle, while the renderer process handles the UI.

Create a main.js file for the main process and a index.html file for the renderer process in your project directory.

Example main.js:

javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

function createWindow() {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true
    }
  })

  win.loadFile('index.html')
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow)

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
})

app.on('activate', () => {
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
    createWindow()
  }
})

Example index.html:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Electron App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Electron!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

5. Update package.json
Modify your package.json to set the "main" field to "main.js" and add a "start" script:

json
{
  "name": "electron-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // Your dependencies here
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^13.0.1"
  }
}

6. Start Your Electron App
You can now start your Electron app by running the following command:

bash
npm start
Your Electron application should open with the "Hello, Electron!" message.

7. Build and Distribute
To package and distribute your Electron app for different platforms, you can use tools like electron-packager or electron-builder. Refer to their documentation for further instructions.

Conclusion
You've successfully set up an Electron.js project. You can now start building your cross-platform desktop application using web technologies. Good luck with your project!
